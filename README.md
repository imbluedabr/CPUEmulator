# Simple CPU emulator

very simple and basic emulator from scratch.

will eventually emulate an i8086, IA-32 (i80386) and maybe also my own 16 bit architecture im developing on an fpga.

### Why?

so i can start working on my own unix like posix compliant kernel in assembly (and maybe some c).

## Status
currently still experimenting with different code structures(just started programing in c++) so not going to have any real progress anytime soon.
