# Simple CPU emulator

very simple and basic emulator from scratch.

Currently emulates my own architecture called micro16, might add an i8086 later or even something with an mmu like the i80286 or 386.

## Why?

started this to test the memory efficiency and programing complexity of my homebrew architectures but now i am using it for development of homebrew operating systems.

## Status

Halted further development since i am focusing on os development and wont make any changes to my architecture soon.
